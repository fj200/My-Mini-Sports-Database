Project name: My Mini Sports Database

Functional requirements:

Almost everyone has a favorite sport that they eagerly follow and constantly engage in. However, there are other fascinating sports in the world that have never seen the light of day. At times we hear the name of these sports but do not know what they are and what they entail. In this project, we gathered a small database containing a short definition of sports. The name of the sport in question can be searched and if available a short definition containing, the number of players, the object of each game, and a short description of how it is done. There is also a list provided of all available definitions in the database for further searching.

• User can access the database on any device.

• User can search their chosen sport name in the search box provided.

• User can search multiple definition in their experience. 

• User can view the list of available definitions.

• User can access the definitions directly from the available list.

• If the sports definition is not available, user can choose to be directed to search that sport online.

• Each sport contains the basic information on each sport.

• For each sport there are images provided.

• For each sport there is a link directed to a video.

• For further information there is page linked to the definition.
