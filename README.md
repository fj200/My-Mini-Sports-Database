Project name: My Mini Sports Database

Functional requirements:

Almost everyone has a favorite sport that they eagerly follow and constantly engage in. However, there are other fascinating sports in the world that have never seen the light of day. At times we hear the name of these sports but do not know what they are and what they entail. In this project, we gathered a small database containing a short definition of sports. The name of the sport in question can be searched and if available a short definition containing, the number of players, the object of each game, and a short description of how it is done. There is also a list provided of all available definitions in the database for further searching.

• The database is available to users on multiple devices. 

• Users can search for their chosen sport name in the search box provided which is at the center of the webpage. 

• Multiple definition are available to the user for a greater experience. 

• There is a list of available sports on the right side of the webpage where users can view available defintions 

• User can access the definitions directly from the available list on the right side of the page. 

• If the sports definition is not available, user can choose to be directed to search that sport online. 

• Each sport contains the basic information on each sport such as the number of players, stars in the sport and many more. 

• For each sport there are images provided showing what sport has been searched for alongside the definition. 

• A video is also available for the user once a link is clicked which appears next to the picture of the sport. 

• Below the description there is a link available which provides further information.
